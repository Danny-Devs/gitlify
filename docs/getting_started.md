# Getting Started with Gitlify

This guide provides a quick overview for different users interacting with Gitlify.

## For End Users (Generating & Exploring PRDs)

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A GitHub account (for saving/community features, not strictly required for basic generation)
- Basic familiarity with GitHub repositories
- _Optional_: A local LLM setup for potentially faster or more private generation (see [LLM Setup Guide](llm_setup_guide.md))

### Quick Start

1.  **Visit the Platform**: Navigate to the Gitlify web application.
2.  **Sign In (Optional)**: Sign in with GitHub for personalized features.
3.  **Generate a PRD**: Find the "New PRD" or similar option. Enter a public GitHub repository URL.
4.  **Configure (Optional)**: Adjust basic analysis settings if needed.
5.  **Start Generation**: Initiate the PRD creation process.
6.  **Explore**: Once complete, browse the generated PRD chapters and diagrams.
7.  **Feedback (Optional)**: Rate the PRD or leave comments if desired.

### Using PRDs

- **Understand Projects**: Grasp goals, requirements, and design decisions.
- **Learn**: Use the requirements as a basis for learning or rebuilding the project.
- **Contribute**: Identify areas for improvement and prepare contributions to the original repository.

## For Developers (Contributing to Gitlify)

To contribute to the Gitlify codebase itself:

1.  **Set Up Environment**: Follow the detailed instructions in the [Development Setup Guide](setup_guide.md).
2.  **Understand Architecture**: Review the [Technical Architecture](technical_architecture.md) document.
3.  **Find an Issue/Task**: Check the project's issue tracker or contribution guidelines.
4.  **Follow Workflow**: Adhere to the branching, coding, testing, and PR process outlined in the [Development Setup Guide](setup_guide.md).
