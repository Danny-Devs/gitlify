# Getting Started with Gitlify

This guide will help you get started with Gitlify, whether you're using the platform to generate PRDs, exploring the PRD library, or contributing to the project's development.

## For Users

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic familiarity with GitHub and software development concepts
- Optional: Local LLM setup for enhanced PRD generation (see [LLM Setup Guide](llm_setup_guide.md))

### Quick Start

1. **Visit the Gitlify Platform**

   - Navigate to [gitlify.io](https://gitlify.io) (or your local development instance)
   - Create an account or sign in with GitHub OAuth

2. **Generate Your First PRD**

   - Click "New PRD" from the dashboard
   - Enter a GitHub repository URL or select from curated options
   - Configure basic analysis options (depth, focus areas)
   - Click "Generate PRD" and wait for the analysis to complete

3. **Explore the PRD**

   - Browse through the generated document sections
   - Use the navigation panel to jump to specific requirements
   - Export the PRD if needed (PDF, Markdown, etc.)

4. **Provide Feedback**
   - Rate the PRD quality
   - Leave comments on specific sections
   - Suggest improvements

### Using PRDs for Learning and Contributing

1. **Understanding Projects**

   - Use the PRD to understand project goals and requirements
   - Compare requirements with actual implementation
   - Learn from design decisions documented in the PRD

2. **Building Your Own Implementation**

   - Use the PRD as a blueprint for your own coding project
   - Build a solution that meets the same requirements
   - Experiment with alternative approaches

3. **Contributing Back**
   - Compare your implementation with the original
   - Identify areas where your approach might be better
   - Prepare meaningful contributions to the original project
