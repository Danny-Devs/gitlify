# Project Vision: Gist of Git

## Core Vision

**Gist of Git** helps developers understand GitHub repositories quickly through AI-powered analysis using locally-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to reduce the time it takes to comprehend unfamiliar code from days to hours.

## The Problem

Developers face significant challenges when working with unfamiliar codebases:

- Understanding existing code takes significantly more time than writing new code
- Documentation is often outdated, incomplete, or missing entirely
- Onboarding to new projects or evaluating dependencies is time-consuming
- Complex codebases can be intimidating, especially for less experienced developers

## Our Solution

Gist of Git provides AI-powered analysis of GitHub repositories with these key benefits:

- **Privacy-first**: All analysis happens on your local machine using your own LLM instances
- **Quick insights**: Generate high-level overviews of repository structure and architecture
- **Customizable analysis**: Use templates to extract specific insights about the codebase
- **Visualization**: See relationships between components, dependencies, and patterns

## Target Users

- **Software Developers**: Looking to understand new codebases quickly
- **Tech Leads**: Evaluating dependencies or helping team members understand code
- **Open Source Contributors**: Wanting to comprehend project structure before contributing
- **Software Engineering Students**: Learning from real-world codebases

## Minimum Viable Product

The initial version of Gist of Git will focus on these core capabilities:

1. **Basic GitHub Integration**:

   - Input a public GitHub repository URL
   - Fetch repository structure and files
   - Display repository contents

2. **Local LLM Integration**:

   - Connect to locally running LLM instances (Ollama, LM Studio)
   - Provide clear setup instructions for users to install these tools
   - Simple configuration for model selection

3. **Analysis Templates**:

   - Basic templates for common analysis types
   - Apply templates to repositories
   - View analysis results in structured format

4. **Simple UI**:
   - Clean, functional interface
   - Repository input
   - Analysis configuration
   - Results display

## Development Approach

We'll build Gist of Git incrementally with these principles:

1. **Start with simplicity**: Focus on core functionality that provides immediate value
2. **User self-service**: Provide clear instructions for components users need to install themselves
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Make the basic version work well before adding advanced features
4. **Rapid iterations**: Build in small, functional increments

## Out of Scope for MVP

To maintain focus on core functionality, these features are intentionally excluded from the initial release:

1. **Private repository access**: Initially supporting only public repositories
2. **User authentication**: Will be added in future versions
3. **Advanced visualizations**: Basic visualizations only in the MVP
4. **Template marketplace**: Future enhancement after core functionality
5. **Complex code analysis**: Focus on high-level insights first

## Success Criteria

We'll consider the MVP successful if:

1. Users can analyze a GitHub repository and receive useful insights
2. Setup process for local LLMs is clear and accessible
3. Analysis process takes less than 5 minutes for a medium-sized repository
4. Users report saving significant time in understanding new codebases

## Next Steps After MVP

Once the core functionality is solid, we'll explore:

1. User authentication and private repository access
2. More advanced analysis templates
3. Template sharing and community features
4. Enhanced visualizations
5. Integration with additional Git platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket)
