# Glossary

This document defines key terminology used throughout the Gitlify project documentation.

## Project-Specific Terms

### Analysis

The process of examining a GitHub repository with LLMs to generate insights about its structure, architecture, dependencies, and other characteristics.

### PRD (Project Requirement Document)

A comprehensive document that outlines the requirements, specifications, and design of a software project, including functional and non-functional requirements, architecture, and implementation details.

### Chapter

A section of a PRD that focuses on a specific aspect of the project requirements or architecture, organized in a progressive manner from high-level concepts to detailed implementation.

### LLM Configuration

Settings that define how to connect to and interact with a local Large Language Model instance.

### Prompt Template

A predefined structure for generating prompts to send to LLMs, designed to extract specific types of insights from repositories.

### Repository Analysis

The process of examining a GitHub repository to extract requirements, architecture, and other insights for PRD generation.

## Technical Terms

### API Key

A unique identifier used for authentication with the Gitlify API.

### Context Window

The maximum number of tokens that an LLM can process in a single operation.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

A machine learning model trained on vast amounts of text data that can generate human-like text and analyze code.

### Local LLM

A Large Language Model that runs on the user's local machine rather than in the cloud, providing privacy and cost benefits.

### Prompt

A specific instruction or query sent to an LLM to guide its response.

### Prompt Engineering

The practice of designing and optimizing inputs to language models to achieve desired outputs.

### Repository

A storage location for a software project containing code, documentation, and other files, typically managed with Git.

### Token

The basic unit of text that LLMs process, which may be a word, part of a word, or a character.

## Technical Stack Terms

### Next.js

A React framework for building web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.

### Prisma

A type-safe database client for TypeScript and Node.js that simplifies database access and management.

### React

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

### PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

### TypeScript

A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static type definitions.

### Ollama

An open-source tool for running Large Language Models locally.

### LM Studio

A desktop application for running and fine-tuning Large Language Models locally.

### REST API

An architectural style for designing networked applications, standing for Representational State Transfer.

## Git and GitHub Terms

### Branch

A parallel version of a repository, allowing work to proceed without affecting the main codebase.

### Commit

A record of changes to a repository, including who made the changes and when.

### Fork

A copy of a repository that allows experimentation without affecting the original project.

### Pull Request

A method of submitting contributions to a repository by proposing changes for review.

### Repository Owner

The user or organization that created and maintains a GitHub repository.

## Development Terms

### Unit Test

A software testing method where individual units or components are tested in isolation.

### Integration Test

Testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group.

### End-to-End Test

Testing that verifies the entire application flow from start to finish.

### Type Safety

A feature that ensures operations are performed on the correct types of data, preventing certain classes of errors.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

A technique where a page is rendered on the server and sent to the client as fully rendered HTML.

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

A technique where a page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript.

### API Route

A server-side endpoint that handles API requests in a Next.js application.

### Progressive Enhancement

A design philosophy that starts with a basic level of user experience and builds up to a more enhanced experience for users with more advanced browser features.

## Additional Terms

### PocketFlow

A workflow system for orchestrating large language model operations across multiple processing steps, handling large repositories and complex analyses effectively.

### Mermaid Diagram

A text-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create diagrams dynamically.

### Rate Limiting

Controlling the number of requests a user can make to an API within a given timeframe.

### Webhook

A mechanism for sending real-time notifications when certain events occur in a system.

### Visualization

Graphical representation of data or concepts to aid understanding, such as architecture diagrams or dependency graphs.

### JSON Schema

A vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.
