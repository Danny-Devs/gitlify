# Gitlify: Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Gitlify** is a platform designed to reverse-engineer comprehensive Project Requirement Documents (PRDs) from public GitHub repositories. The platform analyzes repositories to extract implicit requirements, design decisions, and architectural patterns, then presents them as detailed PRDs. These documents enable developers to rebuild projects from scratch based on requirements rather than code, fostering deeper understanding and facilitating meaningful contributions to open-source projects.

### Value Proposition

Developers struggle with understanding and contributing to unfamiliar codebases. Gitlify solves this by:

- Extracting comprehensive requirements from existing code to reveal the "why" behind implementation decisions
- Creating standardized PRD formats that follow industry best practices
- Building a community-curated library of high-quality software requirement documents
- Enabling developers to rebuild projects from requirements rather than copying code
- Facilitating innovation by allowing developers to implement alternative solutions to the same requirements
- Providing a platform to compare rebuilt implementations with original repositories
- Creating paths for meaningful open-source contributions based on novel implementations

## Core Capabilities

## PRD Structure & Format

### Modular Organization

PRDs will be organized into logical chapters following a progressive learning approach:

1. **Project Overview**: High-level summary of the project's purpose and value
2. **Core Concepts**: Fundamental abstractions and design patterns used
3. **Architecture**: System structure and component relationships (with diagrams)
4. **Functional Requirements**: Detailed specifications for features and capabilities
5. **Technical Requirements**: Implementation constraints and considerations
6. **User Experience**: Flow and interaction specifications
7. **Data Model**: Entity relationships and persistence requirements
8. **API Design**: Interface specifications for services and components
9. **Implementation Considerations**: Notes on technology choices and trade-offs

### Architecture Visualization

Each PRD will include multiple Mermaid diagrams to visualize:

- **Component Relationships**: How different parts of the system interact
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
- **State Transitions**: How the system changes states based on events
- **Entity Relationships**: How data entities relate to each other
- **Deployment Architecture**: How the system is deployed and scaled

Example of a Mermaid diagram in the PRD:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[GitHub Repository] --> B[Repository Analyzer]
    B --> C[Requirements Extractor]
    C --> D[PRD Generator]
    D --> E[Chapter Organizer]
    E --> F[Visualization Creator]
    F --> G[Complete PRD]
    G --> H[Export Module]
    G --> I[PRD Library]
    I --> J[Community Feedback System]
```
