# CodeGrok: Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**CodeGrok** is an application designed to help developers deeply understand public GitHub repositories through AI-powered analysis and progressive learning paths. The platform provides multiple layers of explanation, from high-level architectural overviews to detailed code annotations, alongside interactive visualizations. The primary goal is to reduce the learning curve for complex codebases, enabling users to progress from initial understanding to making meaningful open source contributions.

### Value Proposition

Developers struggle with understanding unfamiliar codebases, especially when considering contributing to open source projects. CodeGrok solves this by:

- Providing multi-layered explanations that adapt to the user's current understanding level
- Generating side-by-side code annotations that explain complex functions and components
- Creating architectural visualizations that illustrate system relationships
- Building progressive learning paths from basic comprehension to contribution readiness
- Identifying opportunities for contributions (missing tests, documentation, refactoring)
- Enabling users to track their progress across repositories they're studying
- Leveraging collective feedback to continuously improve explanations

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Repository Exploration & Explanation

- **Repository Selection**: Curated lists of repositories organized by complexity and domain
- **Multi-layered Explanations**: From high-level overview to detailed implementation
- **Side-by-side Code Annotations**: Explanations that appear alongside the actual code
- **Architectural Summaries**: Bird's-eye views of system components and interactions
- **Design Pattern Recognition**: Identification of common patterns used in the codebase

### 2. Visual Understanding Tools

- **Component Relationship Diagrams**: Visual maps of how different parts interact
- **Execution Flow Visualization**: Tracing how code executes through different functions
- **Dependency Graphs**: Illustration of internal and external dependencies
- **Architecture Diagrams**: High-level system structure visualization
- **Interactive Exploration**: Ability to explore different levels of abstraction

### 3. Progressive Learning Path

- **Knowledge Assessment**: Gauge user's current understanding level
- **Guided Learning Sequence**: Step-by-step path from basics to advanced concepts
- **Spaced Repetition**: Reinforcement of key concepts at optimal intervals
- **Comprehension Checkpoints**: Interactive elements to validate understanding
- **Personalized Learning**: Adapting content based on user progress and feedback

### 4. Contribution Preparation

- **Contribution Opportunity Identification**: Areas where the repository needs improvement
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Finding code that lacks proper testing
- **Documentation Gap Detection**: Identifying poorly documented components
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Potential code improvements that could be contributed
- **Contribution Workflow Guidance**: Step-by-step process for making a pull request

### 5. Community Improvement

- **Explanation Rating System**: Users vote on most helpful explanations
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing different explanation approaches to find the most effective
- **User Feedback Collection**: Gathering specific improvement suggestions
- **Continuous Enhancement**: Using collective wisdom to improve the learning experience
- **Difficulty Assessment**: Community ratings of different repositories' complexity
