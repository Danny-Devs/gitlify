# Gist of Git: Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Gist of Git** is a micro-SaaS application designed to help developers quickly understand GitHub repositories through AI-powered analysis. Users can input a GitHub repository URL, and the application will analyze the codebase using locally-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs), providing structured insights, documentation, and visualizations to expedite comprehension of unfamiliar codebases.

### Value Proposition

Developers often struggle with the time-consuming process of understanding new or complex codebases. Gist of Git addresses this challenge by:

- Rapidly synthesizing repository structure and key components
- Generating concise documentation of architecture and patterns
- Providing AI-powered insights about code complexity and potential issues
- Supporting knowledge sharing and onboarding for development teams

## Documentation Structure

This PRD is organized into several focused documents:

1. [Project Vision and Scope](./vision.md) - Overall project goals and boundaries
2. [User Requirements](./user-requirements.md) - User stories, personas, and journey maps
3. [Functional Requirements](./functional-requirements.md) - Detailed feature specifications
4. [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md) - System design and components
5. [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md) - Development phases and milestones
6. [User Interface Specifications](./ui-specifications.md) - UI/UX design guidelines
7. [Prompt Engineering Framework](./prompt-engineering.md) - LLM interaction design

## Key Stakeholders

- **End Users**: Software developers, technical leads, and newcomers to existing projects
- **Product Owner**: Responsible for product vision and prioritization
- **Development Team**: Responsible for implementation and technical decisions
- **Technical Advisors**: AI/ML specialists providing input on LLM integration

## Success Criteria

1. Users can successfully analyze public GitHub repositories
2. Analysis provides valuable insights that save developers time
3. The application works effectively with local LLM instances
4. UI/UX is intuitive and presents complex information clearly
5. Prompt templates can be shared, rated, and improved by the community

## Out of Scope

1. Authentication with GitHub for private repositories (future feature)
2. Integration with code hosting platforms other than GitHub (future feature)
3. Real-time collaborative analysis (future feature)
4. Deep code quality analysis or security vulnerability scanning

## Timeline

The project will be developed in 3 phases over a 12-week period:

- **Phase 1 (4 weeks)**: Core infrastructure and GitHub integration
- **Phase 2 (4 weeks)**: LLM integration and basic analysis features
- **Phase 3 (4 weeks)**: UI refinement, community features, and prompt marketplace
