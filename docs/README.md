## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation set follows these principles:

1. **Simplicity First** - Start with core functionality before adding complexity
2. **Practical Over Theoretical** - Focus on practical implementation guidance
3. **User Self-Service** - Provide clear instructions for user-managed components (like LLM setup)
4. **Incremental Development** - Build and document in manageable phases
