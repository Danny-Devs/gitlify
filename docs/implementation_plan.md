# Implementation Plan

This document outlines a simplified, incremental approach to building Gist of Git. The focus is on delivering core functionality that provides immediate value, then progressively enhancing the application as we learn from user feedback.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Focus on solving the core problem well before adding complexity
2. **User Self-Service**: Provide clear instructions for user-managed components (like LLM setup)
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship working software in small, valuable increments
4. **Validate Early**: Get feedback on core functionality before building advanced features

## Phase 1: Foundation (2 Weeks)

**Goal**: Create basic application structure and GitHub integration

### Week 1: Project Setup & GitHub Integration

1. **Project Infrastructure**

   - Initialize Next.js application with TypeScript
   - Set up basic styling with TailwindCSS
   - Configure ESLint and testing framework
   - Set up development environment

2. **GitHub API Integration**
   - Create service for fetching and analyzing any public repository data
   - Build basic repository metadata display
   - Implement file browser component
   - Design repository discovery suggestions for learning purposes

### Week 2: Core UI & Database

1. **Core UI Components**

   - Create repository input form
   - Build repository explorer view
   - Implement simple navigation

2. **Data Storage**
   - Set up Prisma with basic schema
   - Implement repository storage
   - Create API routes for repository data

**Deliverables**:

- Working application that can fetch and display GitHub repositories
- Basic UI for exploring repository structure
- Initial database setup

## Phase 2: LLM Integration (2 Weeks)

**Goal**: Connect to local LLMs and implement basic analysis

### Week 3: LLM Connection & Setup Guide

1. **LLM Connector Service**

   - Implement connection to Ollama API
   - Create model detection and selection
   - Build connection testing functionality

2. **User Instructions**
   - Create clear guide for installing Ollama
   - Document model setup process
   - Provide troubleshooting tips

### Week 4: Basic Analysis Implementation

1. **Template System**

   - Create simple template data structure
   - Implement basic template rendering
   - Build template application UI

2. **Analysis Processing**
   - Implement repository analysis workflow
   - Create results storage and retrieval
   - Build basic results display

**Deliverables**:

- Working LLM integration with Ollama
- Clear setup instructions for users
- Basic analysis functionality with simple templates
- Results display

## Phase 3: Refinement & Enhancement (2 Weeks)

**Goal**: Improve user experience and add core features

### Week 5: Results Visualization & UX Improvements

1. **Results Enhancement**

   - Improve formatting of analysis results
   - Implement markdown rendering
   - Add basic syntax highlighting

2. **User Experience**
   - Enhance loading states and progress indicators
   - Implement responsive design improvements
   - Add error handling and recovery

### Week 6: Templates & Testing

1. **Template Expansion**

   - Add additional analysis templates
   - Improve template configuration options
   - Implement template selection UI

2. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Conduct thorough testing
   - Fix identified issues
   - Optimize performance

**Deliverables**:

- Enhanced results display
- Additional analysis templates
- Improved user experience
- More robust error handling

## Future Phases

After delivering the MVP with the core functionality, we'll consider these enhancements based on user feedback:

### Phase 4: Enhanced Analysis

- Advanced template options
- Custom template creation
- More sophisticated visualizations

### Phase 5: User Accounts & Persistence

- User authentication
- History of analyses
- Saved repositories and results

### Phase 6: Community Features

- Template sharing
- Analysis comparison
- Collaborative features

## Development Stack

For maximum simplicity and development speed, we'll use:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (database)

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **LLM Integration Approach**

   - We'll focus on providing great instructions for user-installed LLMs rather than managing installation
   - Documentation will include step-by-step guides for setting up Ollama and recommended models
   - API will be designed to gracefully handle connection issues

2. **GitHub Integration Scope**

   - Focused exclusively on public repositories that anyone can learn from
   - Will use unauthenticated GitHub API with appropriate rate limit handling
   - Repository data will be cached to minimize API calls
   - Emphasis on helping users discover and learn from repositories they don't own
   - Interface will encourage exploration of well-designed open source projects

3. **Initial Feature Limits**
   - Analysis will focus on high-level insights (architecture, structure, patterns)
   - Visualizations will be simple and text-based initially
   - Templates will be predefined (no custom templates in MVP)

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear, incremental path to delivering a valuable product. By focusing on core functionality first and emphasizing simplicity, we can create a solid foundation that solves the main problem while setting up for future enhancements.
