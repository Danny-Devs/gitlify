# Vision and Scope Document

## Project Vision

**Gist of Git** aims to revolutionize how developers interact with and understand codebases by providing rapid, AI-powered insights into GitHub repositories. Our vision is to create a developer tool that dramatically reduces the time required to comprehend unfamiliar code, making software development more efficient and accessible.

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Accelerate Developer Onboarding**: Reduce the time developers need to understand new codebases from days to hours.
2. **Enhance Knowledge Sharing**: Provide a common reference point for discussing code structure and architecture within teams.
3. **Improve Documentation**: Generate clear, accurate documentation that evolves with the codebase.
4. **Foster Community**: Build a community of developers sharing and improving prompt templates for repository analysis.
5. **Promote Local AI**: Demonstrate the effectiveness of locally-hosted LLMs for developer productivity tools.

## Market Opportunity

The software development industry faces significant challenges with knowledge transfer and context sharing:

- Developers spend 58% of their time understanding code rather than writing it
- Outdated or missing documentation is cited as a top productivity obstacle
- Onboarding new team members to existing projects takes weeks or months
- AI tools are increasingly integrated into developer workflows

Gist of Git addresses these pain points by providing immediate, AI-powered understanding of codebases, without relying on expensive cloud AI services.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **Junior Developers**: Need assistance understanding complex codebases quickly
- **Senior Developers**: Want to onboard to new projects efficiently
- **Technical Leads**: Need to understand architecture of potential dependencies
- **Open Source Contributors**: Want to quickly comprehend project structure before contributing

### Secondary Users

- **Technical Recruiters**: Need to understand candidates' project repositories
- **Project Managers**: Want high-level understanding of technical components
- **Technical Writers**: Need to understand code structure for documentation

## Solution Overview

Gist of Git will provide:

1. **Rapid Repository Analysis**: Quick processing of GitHub repositories to extract structure and relationships
2. **Customizable Analysis Templates**: User-definable prompt templates to guide the LLM analysis
3. **Local LLM Integration**: Support for popular local LLM frameworks (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
4. **Visual Code Maps**: Generation of visual representations of code architecture
5. **Documentation Generation**: Creation of comprehensive documentation about repository components
6. **Community Prompt Library**: Shared repository of effective analysis prompts

## Project Scope

### In Scope

1. **GitHub Integration**:

   - Public repository analysis
   - Repository structure mapping
   - Branch and commit history analysis

2. **Local LLM Integration**:

   - Support for Ollama, LM Studio, and LocalAI
   - Optimized prompting for code understanding
   - Caching of analysis results

3. **Analysis Features**:

   - Code structure summarization
   - Dependency relationship mapping
   - Architecture pattern identification
   - Technology stack identification

4. **User Interface**:

   - Repository input and selection
   - Analysis configuration
   - Results presentation and visualization
   - Export to common formats

5. **Community Features**:
   - Prompt template sharing
   - Rating and review system for prompts
   - User feedback collection

### Out of Scope

1. **Private Repository Access**: Authentication and private repo access will be considered for future releases
2. **Non-GitHub Platforms**: Support for GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. will be considered for future releases
3. **Code Modification**: The tool will not modify or suggest changes to code
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: The tool will not track changes to repositories over time
5. **Advanced Security Analysis**: Deep security vulnerability scanning is out of scope

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: Number of unique repositories analyzed
2. **Time Savings**: User-reported time saved in understanding repositories
3. **Template Effectiveness**: Ratings and usage statistics for community templates
4. **Analysis Accuracy**: User feedback on the quality and usefulness of insights
5. **Community Engagement**: Number of shared templates and template improvements

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

- Users have basic understanding of GitHub and repository concepts
- Users can set up and run local LLM instances
- Public GitHub repositories remain accessible via API
- Local LLMs can effectively analyze code with proper prompting

### Constraints

- Performance limited by local hardware capabilities
- Analysis quality dependent on LLM model capabilities
- GitHub API rate limits for repository access
- Repository size may impact analysis time and quality
